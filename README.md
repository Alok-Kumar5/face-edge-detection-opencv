# Face Detection and Edge Detection using OpenCV

This project captures video from the webcam, detects faces using a Haar Cascade Classifier, and applies Sobel edge detection filters to the detected face regions. It allows for capturing snapshots and displays horizontal and vertical edges separately.

## Features
- Real-time face detection using OpenCV's Haar Cascade.
- Sobel filter applied to detect horizontal and vertical edges.
- Snapshot feature to save and view the captured frames.

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV library


2. The webcam will open, and the application will start detecting faces. Horizontal and vertical edges within the detected faces are displayed in separate windows.

3. Press the `s` key to take a snapshot of the current frame. The snapshot will be saved as `snapshot.png` and displayed.

4. To close the application, press the `Esc` key or close the window manually.
